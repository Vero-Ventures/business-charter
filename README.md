## **Project Description**

This project aims to develop a custom Large Language Model (LLM) to assist business owners and families in crafting a "Corporate Charter." The LLM will guide users towards a unified vision, mission, values, and philanthropic goals.

**Traditional Approach:**

- Specialized advisors traditionally handle this process.

**Proposed Solution:**

- The LLM will replace the advisor role by:
    - Employing probing questions to uncover stakeholders' or family members' underlying values and goals.
    - Compiling these findings into a cohesive charter document for review and agreement.
    - Allowing users to edit and refine the charter collaboratively.

**Technical Approach:**

- The LLM will leverage existing LLM APIs, fine-tuned on relevant business literature and regulations.
- Users will interact with the LLM through a progressive web app interface.

## **Programming Language(s)**

- **AI/ML Components:** Primarily Python
- **Progressive Web App Interface:** Typescript

## **Hardware/Software Requirements**

- **Programming Languages:** Python, Typescript
- **Libraries/Frameworks:**
    - PyTorch for deep learning
    - Selenium for web scraping (potentially)
    - Pandas for data manipulation
    - Other AI/ML libraries as needed
- **APIs:** Existing LLM APIs for model interaction
- **Tools:**
    - IDE for development
    - Code interpreter
    - Web browser for research
    - Potentially DevOps tools for CI/CD (continuous integration and deployment)
- **Computational Resources:** Local AI/ML server with high computational power for training, development, and deployment of the LLM.

## **Current Work/Arrangement**

- Currently, charters are developed through consultations with family offices or specialized advisors.
- This project proposes automating and enhancing this process using an LLM.

**Technical Implementation:**

- The development will focus on Python and Typescript.
- Data science, machine learning libraries, and LLM APIs will be used to create the LLM's questioning pipeline and charter compilation functionalities.
